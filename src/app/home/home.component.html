        Since 2016, I have specialized in frontend technologies, starting with
        building responsive interfaces in Angular 1.3 and progressing to
        advanced development with the latest frontend frameworks and NodeJS. I
        excel in gathering requirements, coordinating, and executing software
        development initiatives that address specific business challenges,
        transforming user needs into functional and visually compelling
        solutions. My strong communication skills and teamwork experience allow
        me to collaborate effectively with colleagues throughout every phase of
        the software development process, fostering mutual understanding and
        ensuring efficient project completion.
